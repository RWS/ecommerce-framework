E-Commerce HTML Design
=========================

This is the HTML design package for E-Commerce which gets merged together with the main package.
The content under 'src' is zipped and uploaded to SDL Web:

\100 Master\Building Blocks\Modules\E-Commerce\Admin\E-Commerce HTML Design

Right now there is the following javascripts provided:

* ecommerce-cart - functions to add and remove items to/from the cart
* ecommerce-in-context-menu - some initialization functions for the in-context edit menu
* jquery-ui - JQuery UI, which is needed by the cart functions to animate the product moving into the cart
