Navigation DXA Module
=======================

The navigation module provides an alternative approach to the default DXA navigation.
Instead of having it driven by structure groups and page metadata it provides a pluggable approach of the
navigation. The navigation itself is an region where navigation sections can be dropped in. The navigation secions
themselves can have be implemented with different techniques such as broker queries, list of component links, driven by an E-Commerce system etc.
Currently the navigation module can be rendered as a mega navigation, but other types of navigation experiences can easily be added as new type of regions.

Right now the navigation module is included of simplicity reasons in the SDL Web E-Commerce framework. It will in a later version be
available as a standalone module.
